My name is Jose. I'm 37 years old and I'm computer engineer. I started to work in the Data Analytics team of Groupe Mutuel 10 years ago. I work in the Administration part of the team and we are in charge of the Datawarehouse of the company. I have experienced coding in different languages but not so much in Python (I'm going to work hard :).
